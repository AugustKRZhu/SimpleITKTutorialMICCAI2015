Who Should Attend
-----------------

-  Do you want your students to gain practical experience with
   registration while minimizing their programming load?
-  Do you want to easily experiment with various ITK registration
   configurations, or optimize the settings of a specific registration
   configuration?

If you answered yes to either of these questions, then this tutorial is
for you.

The goal of this half-day tutorial is to introduce students and
researchers to SimpleITKâ€™s interface for the ITK version 4 registration
framework. SimpleITK is, as the name suggests, a simpler interface to
ITK. It provides a procedural interface and bindings to several
interpreted languages, facilitating fast experimentation with ITK
algorithms. In this tutorial we will use the Python programming language
and the IPython Notebook interactive environment to explore the various
features of the ITKv4 registration framework. Key features presented
include: uniform treatment of linear, deformable and composite
transformations, embedded multi-resolution registration and self
calibrating optimizers. Using a hands on approach, participants will
experiment with various registration tasks, learning how to use
SimpleITK.
