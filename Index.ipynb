    "The goal of this half-day tutorial is to introduce students and researchers to SimpleITKâ€™s interface for the ITK version 4 registration framework. SimpleITK is, as the name suggests, a simpler interface to ITK. It provides a procedural interface and bindings to several interpreted languages, facilitating fast experimentation with ITK algorithms. In this tutorial we will use the Python programming language and the IPython Notebook interactive environment to explore the various features of the ITKv4 registration framework. Key features presented include: uniform treatment of linear, deformable and composite transformations, embedded multi-resolution registration and self calibrating optimizers. Using a hands on approach, participants will experiment with various registration tasks, learning how to use"
